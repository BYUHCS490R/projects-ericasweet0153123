                <li>My family has 12 members (excluding spouses). Because our family is quite large in Korea, we were featured on a Korean TV program.</li>
                <li>Among the ten siblings, two of us are married, including me. We are the only ones who live in the United States.</li>
                <li>After all their children became adults, my parents began serving as couple missionaries for our church.</li>

                    <p>My fifth older brother, who graduated from a university with a degree and license in nursing, was hired from a hospital recently. He works in the intensive care unit (ICU), and with his kindness and patience, we believe he&apos;ll do great. His words, “I find a sense of accomplishment when I take care of the people in need,” have become example to me.</p>

                    <p>My nephews and niece attended a Halloween party, wearing costumes. They dressed up as Harry Potter, Simba and Nala. One special thing is that my oldest nephew&apos;s birthday is the day before Halloween. We hope they have a wonderful time with all the celebrations!</p>
