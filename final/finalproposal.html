    <p>Title is "Festivals in Korea". The topic is to introduce various festivals held in Korea.</p>
    <p>I chose this topic motivated by our previous tour-related project. I would like to introduce a variety of festivals for people visiting Korea and I think I hope to share some tips on how to enjoy them! Since Korea experiences four distinct seasons, I want to let people know what kinds of large and diverse events are held, so this became my chosen theme.</p>
