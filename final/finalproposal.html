    <header>Hyojin Cho Final Proposal</header>
    <p>1. Title: Festivals in Korea <br> Topic: This website introduces major festivals in Korea varied by season and offers helpful tips to help visitors enjoy the festivals.
    </p>
    <p>2. I chose this topic motivated by our previous tour-related project. I would like to introduce a variety of festivals for people visiting Korea and I think I hope to share some tips on how to enjoy them! Since Korea experiences four distinct seasons, I want to let people know what kinds of large and diverse events are held, so this became my chosen theme.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3. On the Home page, I&apos;m planning to include the title, a brief introduction to this website, images that illustrate the four seasons of Korea, and an introduction to spring, summer, autumn, winter festivals, a navigation menu, and references section at the bottom.</li>
        <li>On page 1, I&apos;m going to introduce two representative spring festivals. Jinhae Cherry Blossom Festival and Yeouido Spring Flowers Festival are examples. For each festival, I&apos;ll provide information about the location, highlights, festival period, tips such as transportation and what to wear, and relevant photos.</li>
        <li>On page 2, I&apos;m going to introduce two well-known summer festivals. Boryeong Mud Festival, and Busan Sea Festival are examples. For each festival, I&apos;ll provide details about the main activities, reasons for recommending it, tips such as what to wear or applying sunscreen, and appropriate photos.</li>
        <li>On page 3, I&apos;m going to introduce two major autumn festivals. Andong International Mask Dance Festival and Jinju Namgang Lantern Festival are two examples. I&apos;ll explain some traditional cultural elements of the Mask Dance Festival, and I&apos;ll provide some images that capture the festival scenery.</li>
        <li>On page 4, I&apos;m going to introduce two representative winter festivals. Hwacheon Sancheoneo Ice Festival and Taebaeksan Snow Festival are examples. I&apos;ll explain some activities that people can experience such as ice fishing, winter sports, and snow sculpture displays. Also, I&apos;ll provide some tips to prepare for cold weather. Lastly, I&apos;ll include winter images.</li>
        <li>On page 5, I&apos;m going to include a festival planner and tips. I&apos;ll provide a table that shows information on all the main festivals that I covered earlier to view them all at once. Also, I&apos;m going to include a simple form that helps visitors choose which festivals they would participate in according to their schedules. On this page, I&apos;m going to provide helpful links.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>4. As a table content, festival name, city/region, season, typical month, main activities, recommended for will be used. For the form, full name, email address, country/nationality, planned travel month to Korea, preferred activities, a textarea for additional questions, email updates consent checkbox will be included.</p>
    <p>5. For general information about the festivals, I&apos;m going to find specific information from the official festival website and Korea Tourism Organization website ensure its trustworthy and I&apos;ll summarize it. For images, I&apos;m going to use either AI generated pictures or the pictures that are allowed for free use. I&apos;ll clearly state the reference after checking the license. </p>
