        <p>1. JPEG is good for images that has many colors such as photos. It compresses down so it can make the file really small.</p>
        <p>2. GIF is good for cartoons, simple animations and logos. </p>
        <p>3. PNG supports transparent backgrounds. The image quality is not lost using PNG.</p>
        <p>4. One way is we can use the &apos;resize the image&apos; button in the downloaded photo. Other way is we can firstly link the CSS file to html file and use a class selector and set the width.</p>
        <p>5. CSS file doesn&apos;t actually change the size, but it changes how it shows. Also, it&apos;s good to reduce file size with editing file size in photo editing software, not in CSS.</p>
