        </p>
        <h2>Relative</h2>
        <a href="structure.html">structure.html</a>
        <p>Root is the top-level folder on a website. Folder and file names form the path, and the path shows the location from the root to the file.</p>
        <p>The default document is the file that is automatically opened when a user only types the folder name only. Usually, index.html is the default document.</p>
        <p>An absolute link is a link that includes the whole URL. A relative link is a link that is based on the current location.
           <br>
           Relative links are used because they are managed easily when we move or copy files within the same website.</p>
