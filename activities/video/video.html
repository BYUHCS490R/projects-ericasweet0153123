        <p>The positive thing about hosting my videos in YouTube is we can upload an unlimited number of videos for free. Negative things are that ads may appear and some places where YouTube is blocked (e.g. schools) cannot view the videos.</p>
        <p>Useful things we can do with transforms (CSS transforms) are rotate, scale, translate, and skew. It&apos;s useful because we can freely adjust elements without affecting the layout.</p>
        <p>Next week, we have a practice exam and the final exam. The following week, we need to complete our final project.</p>
