        <h2>Difference between block tags and inline tags</h2>
        <p>Block tags start with new lines, and end with new lines. They occupy the whole width of the parent tags. <br> We can control the size with width and height property. Also, margin for up, down, left and right is all applied. <br> However, Inline tags don&apos;t start with new lines. They follow the flow of text. They take up the width for only the portion they need. Also, the margin is applied for only left and right.</p>
        <h2>Margin, Border, and Padding</h2>
        <p>Padding, border, and margin are main parts of CSS Box Model. Padding reveals the blank between content and border. <br> Border means the outline around the padding. Margin is blank outside of the border.</p>
        <h2>Units of measurement</h2>
        <p>These are the units of measurement that I can use in CSS. px means pixels and it&apos;s the most common unit. We can use physical units like cm, mm, in. Also, % is the size of parent units.</p>
        <h2>Figure tag</h2>
        <p>Figure tags are useful when independent contents such as image, illustration, quote, etc. are used to describe or group.</p>
