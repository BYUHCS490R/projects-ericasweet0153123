        <h1>CSS Grid</h1> 
        <div class="parent">
        <p class="child">In HTML, every tag can be both parent and child tags. Child tags are dependent on parent tags. Depending on the structure of the parent tag, the placement and size of the child elements will vary. That's the reason why it's essential when using Grid and Flex.</p>
        <p class="child">The first main difference is Grid is two-dimensional, meaning it uses both columns and rows. The second main difference is how strict the parent is, as a metaphor. As a parent, grid is very strict so that it has to tell the child tag how big it should be. In contrast, as a parent, Flex asks how much space they need and lets them determine their own size.</p>
