    <h1>Hyojin Cho</h1>
    <p>Aloha, my name is Hyojin and I am from South Korea. I'm studying IT &amp; accounting in BYUH. I love studying and working here because I was able to meet great professors and coworkers.</p>
    <p>My favorite hobby is <mark>escape room</mark>. I have done that about 10 times before in my hometown. In a similar vein, I also enjoy watching mystery TV shows.</p>
    <p><br>This is Korean <strong>mystery shows</strong> that I would recommend:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>The Great Escape season 5</li>
        <li>High School Mystery Club season 1</li>
    </ol>
    <p>One of my <em>favorite phrases</em> is this:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <q>You've got to put your past behind you.</q>
    </blockquote>
