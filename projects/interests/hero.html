        <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
        <p><span class="star">McQueen was a rising star</span> in racing that was posting good results. By accident, he ended up in a rural town instead of the racetrack. He met residents who didn&#39;t treat him like a superstar, but as the car that messed up their town. However, while spending time with them, he learned about relationships, humility, and responsibility.</p>
        <h2 class="why">The reaon why he is a hero</h2>
        <p>Even though he could have won the final race, he chose to help another racer who was unfairly injured. McQueen helped him finish the race and became the last car to cross the line. Usually, people might think a good result is all that matters. However, I learned that sometimes results don&#39;t define a person. I thought McQueen&#39;s actions were truly admirable.</p>
