        <h2>The reason for my interests</h2>
        <p>The reason that I became interested in Disney movie quotes is that I realized that the movies, which I loved watching since childhood, offer clear lessons. Even though the main characters make mistakes and show imperfections, they learn important lessons that help them overcome difficulties and grow.</p> 
        <p>The common themes are growth and hope. First, these messages helped me find hope in any situation. Seeing a protagonist who overcomes any specific hardships reminded me that there is hope. Second, even though there are some truths we might miss because of social expectations or strong personal bias, they helped me recognize those lessons as practical wisdom.</p>
        <h2>Quotes and meanings</h2>

        <p>The quote conveys a message that life is a process rather than just reaching a destination because it’s part of the journey. What matters more isn’t the trophy or the victory, but the insights we gain.</p>
        <p>Brave (2012)</p>
        Our fate lives within us. You only have to be brave enough to see it.
        <p>The quote refers to fate isn’t a spell cast by someone else, but it’s shaped by our values and choices. This explains that we have beliefs like seeds, but what’s important is having the courage to live by them.</p>
